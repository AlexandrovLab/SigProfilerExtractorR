Description: SigProfilerExtractorR allows de novo extraction of mutational signatures from data generated in a matrix format. 
  The tool identifies the number of operative mutational signatures, their activities in each sample, 
  and the probability for each signature to cause a specific mutation type in a cancer sample. 
  The tool makes use of SigProfilerMatrixGenerator, SigProfilerAssignment and SigProfilerPlotting.
